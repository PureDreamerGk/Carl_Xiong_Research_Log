**Log Reflection**

1. How did the logs differ in style (not just in content)? What advantages do you see in one style over another?

   Both Jacqui and Tom use MarkDown to record their daily log on GitHub, but the actual layout is different. Tony record most of his daily accomplishments by using the checkbox feature while Jacqui describe her accomplshments in a short paragraph. While Tony like to write his note in a seperate documents and attach it in the log, Jacqui like to directly write her note in the log. Both styles are concise and easy for reader to read. On the other hand, Miranda made a personal site to record her logs. It's really easy for reader to access a specefic log since she provided a catalog. I could feel the enthuastism from her through reading her daily achivements because her language are more lively. She also have a clear classification between goal, accompliments and notes. Finally, Adrian recorded log in google doc, which was novice friendly since most undergraduate student used it. The syntax is simple yet effective.
   
2. How do you think the logs were useful, both to the researcher as well as those working with the researcher?
 
   Researcher logs were useful to both reseracher and his or her peer because it provide a detailed progress of one's contribution to the team. For reseracher, the log would be extermely useful to trace back to some prior works when the reserach were conducted for a long period of time. The log will also benefit those who work with the reseracher since they could have a good understanding on how the reseracher's progress. 
   
3. Did the students keeping their logs seem to meet their goals? Did they get better at meeting their goals over time?

   I believe all students from the sample done a great job on keeping their logs and meet their goals by the deadline. The log provide a clear to-do list, which serve the same function of the deadline of an assignment in classes. Student could better manage their time and efforts when their goal is claerly elaborated. I denfiently feel that all students from the sample get better at meeting their goals and writing their logs.
  
4. Anything else you want to say about the logs?

    I really appreciate reading all the students' log because it provides me an abstract of the reserach process in the project. It is always great to look at some work done by former students because it conforts my little anxiety.
