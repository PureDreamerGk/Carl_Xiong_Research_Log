1. How did the logs differ in style (not just in content)? What advantages do you see in one style over another?

2. How do you think the logs were useful, both to the researcher as well as those working with the researcher?

3. Did the students keeping their logs seem to meet their goals? Did they get better at meeting their goals over time?

4. Anything else you want to say about the logs?
